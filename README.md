# Customer-Churn-Prediction-in-Telecom-Industries
In the telecom sector, customer churn prediction analysis entails identifying customers who are likely to cancel their services and taking preventative efforts to keep them. For telecom businesses, it is a crucial responsibility because losing consumers can have a big influence on their revenue and market share.

Telecom firms can proactively identify customers who are likely to churn and take actions to retain them, such as offering loyalty programmes, personalised offers, or improved customer care, by employing customer churn prediction analysis. As a result, the organisation may see an increase in revenue as well as lower client churn and improved customer satisfaction.
